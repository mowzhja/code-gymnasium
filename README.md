# About
I collect various exercises from sites like [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) et alia in this repo and organize them by language, which allows me to practice writing in that language and also to have a quick reference for the future.

# Notice
Watch out, the code in this repo is pretty ugly/sometimes spaghetti/not DRY/hopefully KISS. In short: it's kind of hacky (meant to be that way).
